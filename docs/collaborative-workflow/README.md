2. Human reviews for completeness and accuracy
3. AI refines based on feedback
4. Final documentation is approved by human

## Pull Request Process

### PR Creation by AI

AI creates pull requests with the following template:

```markdown
## Feature Description

[Brief description of the feature implemented]

## Implementation Details

- [Key implementation decisions]
- [Architectural patterns used]
- [Libraries/frameworks leveraged]

## Testing

- [Test coverage summary]
- [Manual testing performed]
- [Edge cases considered]

## Documentation

- [Documentation added/updated]
- [API changes documented]

## Areas for Human Review

- [Specific areas that need careful review]
- [Complex logic explanations]
- [Security considerations]
- [Performance considerations]

## Screenshots/Videos

[If applicable]
```
````

### PR Review by Human

Humans review PRs focusing on:

1. **Requirement Alignment**: Does the implementation satisfy all acceptance criteria?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code maintainable, efficient, and following standards?
3. **Security**: Are there any potential security issues?
4. **Performance**: Are there performance concerns with the implementation?
5. **Testing**: Is test coverage adequate and are edge cases handled?
6. **Documentation**: Is the documentation complete and accurate?

### Feedback Loop

1. Human provides specific, actionable feedback on the PR
2. AI acknowledges feedback and implements changes
3. AI explains reasoning behind implementation decisions when questioned
4. Human approves PR once satisfied with changes

## Decision-Making Framework

### AI Decision Authority

- Implementation details within established patterns
- Test case generation
- Documentation structure
- Refactoring within a component
- Error handling implementation

### Human Decision Authority

- Architectural decisions
- Technology stack choices
- Security-related implementations
- Third-party service integration
- Final approval of features
- Performance optimization approaches

### Joint Decisions

- Component design
- API design
- State management approach
- Database schema design
- UI/UX implementation details

## Handling Disagreements

When AI and human perspectives differ:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Revisit the original requirements to ensure shared understanding
2. **Explain Reasoning**: Both parties explain their reasoning with concrete examples
3. **Research Alternatives**: Explore alternative approaches together
4. **Prototype Options**: Implement small prototypes to compare approaches if necessary
5. **Human Decision**: Human has final decision authority if consensus can't be reached

## Continuous Improvement

After each feature completion:

1. **Retrospective**: Document what worked well and what could be improved
2. **Pattern Documentation**: Add successful patterns to the documentation
3. **Process Refinement**: Update this workflow document based on lessons learned
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Ensure insights are shared across the team
