2. **[Technical Specifications](./technical-specs/)** - Coding standards, patterns, and conventions
3. **[Component Library](./component-library/)** - UI components and design system documentation
4. **[Integrations](./integrations/)** - Third-party service integration details
5. **[Prompt Engineering](./prompt-engineering/)** - Guidelines for effective AI prompts
6. **[Testing](./testing/)** - Testing strategies and requirements
7. **[Feature Requirements](./feature-requirements/)** - User stories and acceptance criteria
8. **[Deployment](./deployment/)** - Deployment processes and environment configurations

10. **[Cursor Rules](./cursor-rules/)** - Guidelines for effective Cursor AI interaction

## Purpose and Usage

This documentation serves multiple purposes:

- **Guide for AI Development**: Provides context and specifications for AI to generate appropriate code and documentation
- **Reference for Human Collaborators**: Ensures all team members understand the project structure and requirements
- **Knowledge Repository**: Captures decisions, patterns, and solutions for future reference
- **Onboarding Resource**: Helps new team members (both human and AI) quickly understand the project

## Documentation Maintenance

- All documentation should be kept up-to-date as the project evolves
- Each major feature or architectural change should be accompanied by corresponding documentation updates
- Documentation PRs should be reviewed with the same rigor as code PRs
- The documentation structure itself can evolve as needed

## How to Contribute

1. Identify the appropriate section for your documentation
2. Follow the README guidelines in that section
3. Use Markdown for all documentation files
4. Include diagrams and visual aids where helpful (using PlantUML, Mermaid, or similar tools)
5. Cross-reference related documentation when appropriate

Remember that high-quality documentation is essential for successful AI-assisted development, as it provides the context needed for AI to generate appropriate solutions.
