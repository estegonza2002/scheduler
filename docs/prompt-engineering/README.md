## Example: Component Creation Prompt Template

```markdown
# React Component Creation Prompt Template

## Purpose

This template helps generate consistent, well-structured React components that follow project conventions and best practices.

## Template Structure
```

I need to create a [COMPONENT_TYPE] component called [COMPONENT_NAME] for the Employee Shift Schedule App.

Purpose: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION_OF_COMPONENT_PURPOSE]

Requirements:

1. [REQUIREMENT_1]
2. [REQUIREMENT_2]
3. [REQUIREMENT_3]
   ...

Component Props:

- [PROP_NAME_1]: [TYPE] - [DESCRIPTION]
- [PROP_NAME_2]: [TYPE] - [DESCRIPTION]
  ...

Component States:

- [STATE_NAME_1]: [TYPE] - [DESCRIPTION]
- [STATE_NAME_2]: [TYPE] - [DESCRIPTION]
  ...

Component should handle these events:

- [EVENT_1]
- [EVENT_2]
  ...

Design considerations:

- [DESIGN_CONSIDERATION_1]
- [DESIGN_CONSIDERATION_2]
  ...

Please use TypeScript with proper typing and follow our established coding standards including:

- Component file structure
- Error handling patterns
- Loading state management
- Accessibility requirements

Interactions with other components:

- [INTERACTION_1]
- [INTERACTION_2]
  ...

## Example Usage

### Prompt Example: Shift Card Component

```

I need to create a composite component called ShiftCard for the Employee Shift Schedule App.

Purpose: Display a summary of a single shift assignment with key information and actions.

Requirements:

1. Display shift time range, location, and position
2. Show employee assigned to the shift (or "Unassigned")
3. Include status indicator (scheduled, in-progress, completed, missed)
4. Provide quick actions (view details, edit, delete) based on user permissions
5. Should be responsive and work on both mobile and desktop views

Component Props:

- shift: ShiftData - The complete shift data object
- onEdit: (shiftId: string) => void - Handler for edit action
- onDelete: (shiftId: string) => Promise<boolean> - Handler for delete action
- onViewDetails: (shiftId: string) => void - Handler for view details action
- userRole: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'employee' - Current user's role for permission checks
- className?: string - Optional className for styling

Component States:

- isDeleting: boolean - Whether delete operation is in progress
- isMenuOpen: boolean - Whether action menu is open
- isConfirmingDelete: boolean - Whether showing delete confirmation

Component should handle these events:

- Click on view details
- Click on edit (if user has permission)
- Click on delete with confirmation (if user has permission)
- Hover to show additional information

Design considerations:

- Use color coding for different shift statuses
- Show clear visual differentiation for unassigned shifts
- Maintain accessibility with proper contrast for status colors
- Include loading states while actions are processing

Please use TypeScript with proper typing and follow our established coding standards including:

- Component file structure
- Error handling patterns
- Loading state management
- Accessibility requirements

Interactions with other components:

- Uses Badge component for status display
- Uses Menu component for action menu
- May use Avatar component to show employee image
- Should work within both List and Grid container components

Additional context:
This component will be used on both the daily schedule view and the employee detail view. Performance is important as there may be dozens of these rendered simultaneously.

```

## Analysis of Successful Components

### What Makes This Prompt Effective:

1. **Clear Structure**: The prompt clearly separates different aspects of the component requirements
2. **Specificity**: It includes details about props, state, and behaviors
3. **Context**: It provides information about where and how the component will be used
4. **Constraints**: It specifies design and technical requirements
5. **Integration Information**: It explains how this component interacts with others

### Common Prompt Issues to Avoid:

1. **Vague Requirements**: "Create a nice shift display component" lacks specifics
2. **Missing Type Information**: Not specifying prop and state types
3. **Conflicting Requirements**: Asking for incompatible features
4. **No Error Handling**: Forgetting to specify how errors should be handled
5. **Forgetting Accessibility**: Not mentioning accessibility requirements
6. **Omitting Context**: Not explaining where/how the component will be used
```

## AI Limitations and Workarounds

For complex components, consider these strategies:

1. **Break It Down**: Split complex components into smaller parts
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a basic version, then enhance
3. **Focus on Structure First**: Get the component structure right, then add details
4. **Reference Existing Code**: Point to similar components as examples
5. **Be Explicit About Edge Cases**: Clearly specify how edge cases should be handled

AI should use these templates and examples when generating code, adapting them to the specific needs of each development task.
