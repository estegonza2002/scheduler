# Feature Requirements Documentation

This directory contains the functional and non-functional requirements for features in the Employee Shift Schedule App. These documents serve as the source of truth for what each feature should do and how it should behave.

## Purpose

The feature requirements documentation provides AI with:

- Clear understanding of feature objectives
- Detailed functional requirements
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and constraints
- Business rules and validation requirements
- Integration points with other features

## What to Document Here

### Core Feature Requirements

- Employee management
- Shift scheduling
- Time tracking
- Notification system
- Reporting and analytics
- Communication tools
- Integration capabilities

### User Stories

For each feature, document relevant user stories following this format:

- **As a** [user role]
- **I want to** [action/goal]
- **So that** [benefit/value]

### Acceptance Criteria

For each user story, document the acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete, including:

- Functional requirements
- UI/UX requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Accessibility requirements

### Business Rules

Document the business logic and rules that govern feature behavior:

- Validation rules
- Calculation methodologies
- Workflow rules
- Permission requirements
- Compliance requirements

### Data Requirements

Document the data needed for each feature:

- Data entities and relationships
- Required fields and data types
- Data validation rules
- Data flow between components
- Data persistence requirements

## Guidelines for AI Documentation

- Document each feature with clear objectives and scope
- Break down complex features into smaller components
- Include user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Document edge cases and error scenarios
- Define integration points with other features
- Include performance and security considerations
- Document business rules and constraints

# Shift Scheduling Feature

## Overview

The Shift Scheduling feature allows managers to create, manage, and publish work schedules for employees. It provides tools for efficient scheduling, conflict detection, and schedule distribution.

## Objectives

- Enable managers to create shift schedules efficiently
- Reduce scheduling conflicts and coverage gaps
- Provide clear schedule visibility to employees
- Support recurring shift patterns and templates
- Enable schedule adjustments and change management

## User Stories

### For Managers

1. **Creating Schedules**

   - **As a** manager
   - **I want to** create weekly schedules by assigning employees to shifts
   - **So that** I can ensure proper staffing coverage

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - Manager can select a week to schedule
   - Manager can view all employees and their availability
   - Manager can assign employees to shifts with drag-and-drop
   - System highlights conflicts with employee availability
   - System shows staffing level indicators for each shift
   - Schedule can be saved as draft or published

2. **Using Templates**

   - **As a** manager
   - **I want to** create and apply schedule templates
   - **So that** I can quickly generate recurring schedules

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - Manager can save current schedule as a template
   - Manager can apply a template to a future week
   - System adjusts for employee availability when applying templates
   - Manager can modify template-generated schedules
   - Templates can be managed (renamed, deleted, etc.)

3. **Publishing Schedules**

   - **As a** manager
   - **I want to** publish schedules and notify employees
   - **So that** employees are informed of their upcoming shifts

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - Manager can publish schedules for a specific date range
   - System sends notifications to employees about new schedules
   - Published schedules are marked as such in the UI
   - Changes to published schedules trigger notifications
   - Publish action requires confirmation

### For Employees

1. **Viewing Schedules**

   - **As an** employee
   - **I want to** view my upcoming shifts
   - **So that** I know when I'm scheduled to work

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - Employee can view personal schedule for current and future weeks
   - Schedule displays shift times, locations, and positions
   - Employee receives notifications for new or changed shifts
   - Schedule is accessible on mobile and desktop
   - Calendar view and list view options are available

2. **Setting Availability**

   - **As an** employee
   - **I want to** set my availability preferences
   - **So that** managers schedule me when I'm available

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - Employee can set recurring availability patterns
   - Employee can set one-time availability exceptions
   - Changes to availability don't affect already-published schedules
   - Employee can view pending availability change requests
   - System confirms when availability changes are approved

## Business Rules

1. **Scheduling Constraints**

   - Employees cannot be scheduled for overlapping shifts
   - Shifts must respect minimum time between shifts (8 hours by default)
   - Full-time employees should have between 30-40 hours per week
   - Part-time employees should have maximum 29 hours per week
   - Required skills/certifications must be met for specialized positions

2. **Availability Rules**

   - Availability changes must be submitted at least 7 days in advance
   - Availability changes don't affect already-published schedules
   - Manager approval is required for availability exceptions
   - System should warn when scheduling outside availability but not prevent it

3. **Publication Rules**
   - Schedules should be published at least 7 days in advance
   - Changes to published schedules require manager approval
   - Employees must be notified of all schedule changes
   - Schedule conflicts must be resolved before publication

## Data Requirements

### Shift Entity

- ID (unique identifier)
- Start time (datetime)
- End time (datetime)
- Position (reference to position entity)
- Location (reference to location entity)
- Employee assigned (reference to employee entity, nullable)
- Status (draft, published, completed, etc.)
- Notes (text, optional)

### Template Entity

- ID (unique identifier)
- Name (string)
- Description (string, optional)
- Owner (reference to manager who created it)
- Shift patterns (collection of shift definitions)
- Default assignments (optional employee assignments)

### Availability Entity

- ID (unique identifier)
- Employee (reference to employee entity)
- Day of week (for recurring) or Date (for one-time)
- Start time (time)
- End time (time)
- Type (available, preferred, unavailable)
- Recurrence pattern (weekly, biweekly, etc., for recurring)
- Notes (text, optional)

## Integration Points

- **Employee Management**: Uses employee data, positions, skills
- **Time Tracking**: Provides shift data for clock in/out validation
- **Notification System**: Triggers notifications for schedule events
- **Reporting**: Provides data for schedule and labor reports
- **Calendar**: Exports schedules to employee calendars

## Performance Considerations

- Schedule view should load in under 2 seconds
- Drag-and-drop operations should have no perceptible lag
- System should handle up to 500 employees in schedule view
- Template application should process in under 5 seconds
- Schedule conflicts should be detected in real-time during editing

## Security Considerations

- Managers can only view/edit schedules for their departments
- Employees can only view their own schedules and limited team info
- Schedule history should be maintained for audit purposes
- All schedule changes should be logged with editor information
- Published schedules require appropriate role permissions

## Accessibility Requirements

- Schedule views must be navigable via keyboard
- Color is not the only means to convey schedule information
- All interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes
- Time inputs support manual entry and selection
- Mobile interface elements are sized appropriately for touch
```

AI should use this template as a guide when documenting feature requirements, adapting it to the specific needs of each feature in the application.
