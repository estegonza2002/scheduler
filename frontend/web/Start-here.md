# Scheduler Application - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This is a web-based scheduling application built with React and TypeScript. The application allows users to create, view, and manage schedules.

## Current Progress

The frontend application structure has been set up with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other necessary dependencies.

## Implementation Tasks

### In Progress

- User interface for schedule creation and management
- API integration for schedule data

### Next Tasks

1. **Complete the schedule creation form**

   - Implement date/time selection
   - Add validation for form inputs
   - Create schedule preview component

2. **Implement schedule viewing functionality**

   - Create calendar view component
   - Implement day, week, and month views
   - Add filter options for viewing schedules

3. **User authentication**

   - Implement login/signup functionality
