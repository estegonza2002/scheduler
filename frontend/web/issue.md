## Feature Request: Admin Account Management and Employee Invitation System

### Overview

We need to implement functionality for account owners to invite additional employees to the system and manage admin privileges. The system will now have distinct roles: **Admin(s)** and **Employees**.

### Requirements

- **Role Separation**:

  - Clearly defined roles for Account Owners (super admins), Admins, and Employees
  - Proper permission structure to control access to system features

- **Invitation System**:

  - Account owners should be able to send email invitations to new employees
  - Invitation emails should include a secure signup link with role pre-assignment
  - Invitation status tracking (Pending, Accepted, Expired)

- **Admin Management**:

  - Account owners should be able to promote regular employees to admin status
  - Account owners should be able to revoke admin privileges
  - Admin status should grant additional system permissions

- **User Interface Requirements**:

  - Admin dashboard with user management section
  - User listing with roles, status, and management options
  - Role assignment interface
  - Invitation form with email validation

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Proper validation of invitation links
  - Expiration mechanism for invitation links (24-48 hours)
  - Audit logging for all admin privilege changes
  - Prevention of privilege escalation vulnerabilities

### Technical Considerations

- Update user model to include role-based permissions
- Implement secure invitation token generation
- Set up email delivery for invitations
- Create proper authorization middleware for admin-only routes
- Follow existing UI/UX patterns (using shadCN components with Tailwind)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Account owners can invite new employees via email
- New employees can register through invitation links
- Account owners can promote/demote admins
- Admin users have appropriate permissions
- All operations properly validate user permissions
- UI is consistent with existing design system
- End-to-end tests confirm all functionality works as expected

### Out of Scope (for future iterations)

- Detailed role customization/fine-grained permissions
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Self-service account deletion
