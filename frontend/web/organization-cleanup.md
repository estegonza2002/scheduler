# Organization Context Cleanup Plan

## Current Situation

✅ We've successfully addressed the duplicate organization-related functionality:

1. ✅ `src/lib/organization.tsx` - Deleted (contained an `OrganizationProvider` and `useOrganization` hook)
2. ✅ `src/lib/organization-context.tsx` - Kept (contains the proper `OrganizationProvider` and `useOrganization` hook)
3. ✅ `src/lib/organization-utils.ts` - Kept (contains utility functions for organization management)
4. ✅ `src/hooks/useOrganizationId.ts` - Fixed to use organization-context functions
5. ✅ Removed any duplicate files with misspelled names

The duplication that caused errors (like the StripeProvider error) has been eliminated.

## Files Kept

We kept:

- ✅ `src/lib/organization-context.tsx` (primary implementation)
- ✅ `src/lib/organization-utils.ts` (utility functions)
- ✅ One version of `useOrganizationId.ts` hook (fixed to use organization-context)

## Files Deleted

We deleted:

- ✅ `src/lib/organization.tsx` (redundant implementation)
- ✅ Any duplicate useOrganizationId.ts files (kept only one correct implementation)

## Completed Cleanup Process

### 1. ✅ Inventory References to Deprecated Files

We located all imports of the deprecated `organization.tsx` file:

```bash
grep -r "from ['\"].*\/organization['\"]" src/
```

### 2. ✅ Update All Imports

For each file with imports from `./organization`:

- Updated imports to use `./organization-context` instead
- Updated property references as needed
  - `organization` → `currentOrganization`
  - Made sure interface usage is consistent

### 3. ✅ Fix useOrganizationId Hook

- Ensured there's only one implementation (properly spelled)
- Updated it to use functions from `organization-context.tsx` and `organization-utils.ts`

### 4. ✅ Check for TypeScript Issues

- Ran TypeScript compilation to catch any type errors
- Fixed any property mismatches between the two implementations

### 5. ✅ Update Feature Usage

Looked for the following specific usages:

- Component properties
- Function parameter differences
- Return value expectations

### 6. ✅ Delete Deprecated Files

After all references were updated and the app was confirmed to be working:

1. ✅ Deleted `src/lib/organization.tsx`
2. ✅ Removed any duplicate hooks
3. ✅ Verified app still functions correctly

### 7. ✅ Test Key Functionality

Tested the following features to ensure they work after cleanup:

- Login/authentication flow
- Organization selection/switching
- Multi-organization support
- Stripe integration (previously broken)
- Any organization-dependent features

## Affected Components

The following components have been updated:

1. ✅ `App.tsx` - Provider nesting and imports
2. ✅ `StripeProvider` - Fixed to use organization-context
3. ✅ All components using organization context
4. ✅ All utility functions calling organization-related methods

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

- Document the organization context architecture
- Add comments in code explaining the pattern
- Consider using barrel exports (index.ts) to create a unified API surface
- Add additional tests for context availability
- Use consistent naming conventions (no spelling variations like "Organization" vs "Orgnization")
