# Automated Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the reliability and quality of our application. We will implement multiple layers of testing to provide adequate coverage and confidence in our codebase.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on:

- Individual utility functions
- Hooks
- Context providers
- Pure UI components

These tests will verify that components function correctly in isolation and meet their intended requirements.

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify the interactions between:

- Connected components
- Component interactions with hooks and providers
- Form submissions and API interactions

These tests will ensure that components work together as expected within the application.

### 3. End-to-End Tests

E2E tests will simulate real user flows:

- Authentication flows
- Business critical processes
- Cross-component interactions
- Full page functionality

These tests provide confidence that complete user journeys function correctly.

### 4. API Tests

API tests will validate:

- Endpoint functionality
- Error handling
- Response formats
- Database interactions

These tests ensure our backend services are functioning as expected.

## Technologies and Tools

We will use the following tools for our testing strategy:

- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library

  - Fast execution
  - Component-focused testing
  - Simulated user interactions

- **End-to-End Tests**: Cypress

  - Browser-based testing
  - Visual test runner
  - Network request mocking
  - Real DOM interactions

- **API Tests**: Supertest + Jest

  - HTTP request testing
  - Response validation
  - Endpoint coverage

- **Test Coverage**: Jest's built-in coverage tools
  - Statement coverage
  - Branch coverage
  - Function coverage

## Testing Philosophy

We will follow the "Testing Trophy" approach:

1. **Most tests**: Integration tests
2. **Fewer tests**: Unit tests and E2E tests
3. **Fewest tests**: Static analysis

This approach gives us the most confidence with the least amount of maintenance burden.

## Implementation Priorities

1. Set up testing infrastructure
2. Create test utilities and mocks
3. Implement tests for core utilities and providers
4. Add tests for critical user flows
5. Gradually increase test coverage for other components

## Mocking Strategy

1. Create mock providers for context-based testing
2. Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
3. Create realistic test fixtures for each entity type
4. Use dependency injection to make components testable

## Test Organization

Tests will be organized following the same structure as the application code:

```
src/
  components/
    Button/
      Button.tsx
      Button.test.tsx
  hooks/
    useTheme.ts
    useTheme.test.ts
  providers/
    ThemeProvider.tsx
    ThemeProvider.test.tsx
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests will be run:

- On each pull request
- Before merging to main branch
- On scheduled intervals for the main branch

Failed tests will block merges to ensure code quality.

## Code Coverage Goals

We aim for:

- 80% coverage for utility functions
- 70% coverage for hooks and providers
- 50% coverage for components
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage

## Best Practices

1. Tests should be:

   - Fast to run
   - Easy to understand
   - Deterministic (no flakiness)
   - Independent of each other

2. Follow the AAA pattern:

   - Arrange - Set up test data and conditions
   - Act - Perform the action being tested
   - Assert - Verify the expected outcome

3. Test behavior, not implementation:

   - Test what the component does, not how it does it
   - Minimize implementation details in tests
   - Focus on user-facing behavior

4. Component Testing Guidelines:
   - Query elements as a user would (by role, text, etc.)
   - Avoid querying by test IDs except when necessary
   - Test accessibility where appropriate

## Timeline

This testing strategy will be implemented incrementally:

1. Phase 1: Infrastructure setup (1-2 weeks)
2. Phase 2: Core utilities and helpers (2-3 weeks)
3. Phase 3: Critical components and flows (3-4 weeks)
4. Phase 4: Coverage expansion (ongoing)

## Dependencies

- React Testing Library packages
- Jest configuration
- Cypress setup
- CI/CD integration
