# Stripe Integration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for implementing Stripe as our payment processing and subscription management platform. The integration will handle subscriptions, payments, and billing functionality for our application.

## Goals

1. Implement secure, reliable payment processing
2. Set up subscription management for multiple pricing tiers
3. Provide transparent billing information to users
4. Maintain PCI compliance
5. Create seamless user experience for payment flows

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Backend API**

   - Stripe webhook handlers
   - Subscription management endpoints
   - Payment method management
   - Invoice retrieval

2. **Database Structure**

   - Stripe customer mapping to organizations
   - Subscription status and details
   - Payment method information (tokenized)
   - Invoice records

3. **Frontend Components**
   - StripeProvider context
   - BillingPage UI
   - Payment method management
   - Subscription selection

### Data Flow

1. **Subscription Creation**

   - User selects plan
   - Frontend creates Stripe Checkout session
   - User redirected to Stripe hosted checkout
   - Webhook notifies application of successful subscription
   - Database updated with subscription details

2. **Payment Method Management**

   - Stripe Elements collects card information
   - Card tokenized through Stripe.js
   - Token sent to server for storage
   - Card details stored only in Stripe

3. **Subscription Updates**

   - Plan upgrades/downgrades processed through API
   - Prorated charges calculated by Stripe
   - Subscription status updated through webhooks

4. **Invoice Management**
   - Invoices generated by Stripe
   - Webhook notifies application of new invoices
   - Invoices available for viewing in billing dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Stripe API Keys

- Production and development keys
- Stored securely in environment variables
- Never exposed to the client

### Webhook Implementation

- Stripe generates events for subscription lifecycle
- Backend endpoints process webhook events
- Events verified using Stripe signatures
- Database updated based on event type

### Subscription Management

- Plans defined in Stripe dashboard
- Subscription status synced to application
- Support for trial periods
- Handling cancellation and reactivation

### User Experience

- Clear pricing display
- Seamless checkout with Stripe Checkout
- Easy subscription management
- Transparent billing history

## Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**

   - No card data stored in our application
   - Use of Stripe Elements for secure card collection
   - Tokenization of payment information

2. **API Security**

   - Secure storage of API keys
   - Webhook signature verification
   - HTTPS for all communications

3. **Access Controls**
   - Role-based access to billing functions
   - Proper authorization for payment operations
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Testing Strategy

1. **Development Environment**

   - Use Stripe test mode
   - Test cards for different scenarios
   - Simulate webhook events

2. **Test Cases**

   - Subscription creation, modification, cancellation
   - Payment method addition, removal, updates
   - Invoice generation and retrieval
   - Error handling (failed payments, etc.)

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automated tests for subscription flows
   - Integration tests for webhook handlers
   - Performance testing for critical paths

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

- Set up Stripe account
- Configure API keys and webhooks
- Implement database schema changes

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- Create BillingAPI interface
- Implement webhook handlers
- Build initial frontend components

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

- Thorough testing in test mode
- User acceptance testing
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Production Deployment

- Switch to production API keys
- Gradual rollout to customers
- Monitor performance and issues

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor webhook delivery and processing
- Track failed payments and retry strategies
- Regular audits of subscription status
- Monitoring of Stripe API changes and updates

## Dependencies

- Stripe account and API access
- Backend API support for webhooks
- Database migrations for new schema
- Frontend components for payment UI

## Documentation Requirements

- Developer documentation for Stripe integration
- User guides for managing subscriptions
- Internal documentation for troubleshooting
- API documentation for billing endpoints

## Alternatives Considered

- PayPal integration
- Braintree payment processing
- Custom billing implementation

These alternatives were rejected due to Stripe's superior developer experience, feature set, and security model.
