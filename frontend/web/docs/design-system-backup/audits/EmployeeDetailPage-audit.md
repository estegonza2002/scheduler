# EmployeeDetailPage.tsx Audit Results

## Overview

The EmployeeDetailPage.tsx component displays detailed information about an employee, including their profile, statistics, assigned locations, contact information, and shift history. This page requires refactoring to align with our design system standards by removing custom wrapper components and using direct shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS.

## Issues Identified

### Custom Wrapper Components

- ✅ **PageHeader**: Used at the top of the page
- ✅ **ContentContainer**: Used to wrap the entire page content
- ✅ **ContentSection**: Used multiple times to organize content into sections
- ✅ **LoadingState**: Used for loading states

### Styling Issues

- Mixed usage of direct Tailwind classes and custom components
- Some sections with fixed layout structures that could use more flexible Tailwind patterns
- Inconsistent spacing in some areas

### Component Structure

- The component is well-structured but relies heavily on custom wrapper components
- Some nested component structures could be simplified

## Refactoring Plan

1. **Replace PageHeader**:

   - Replace with direct Tailwind header pattern as defined in tailwind-guidelines.md
   - Maintain back button and actions functionality

2. **Replace ContentContainer**:

   - Replace with standard Tailwind container pattern
   - Maintain proper spacing and max-width constraints

3. **Replace ContentSection**:

   - For sections using cards: Replace with direct shadcn Card components
   - For flat sections: Replace with appropriate Tailwind div structures
   - Maintain consistent header patterns across sections

4. **Replace LoadingState**:

   - Replace with standard Tailwind loading spinner pattern

5. **Other Improvements**:
   - Ensure consistent spacing throughout the page
   - Use Tailwind's responsive utilities for better mobile experiences
   - Use shadcn's semantic color variables consistently

## Expected Outcome

After refactoring, the EmployeeDetailPage will:

- Have no custom wrapper components
- Use direct shadcn/ui components with Tailwind classes
- Maintain the same functionality and visual structure
- Follow the established design system patterns consistently
- Be easier to maintain and update with design system changes

## Refactoring Priority

This refactoring is marked as **Medium** priority as it is a frequently used page by managers but not as critical as the dashboard and schedule pages.
