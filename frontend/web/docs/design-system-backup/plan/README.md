# Design System Implementation Plan

This directory contains the implementation plan and tracking for our design system using shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS.

## Directory Structure

- `start-here.md` - The primary entry point for the design system implementation plan
- `eslint/` - ESLint rules implementation for design system enforcement
- `audits/` - Detailed audit results for each page
- `workshops/` - Training materials for the design system

## Getting Started

To understand the current status and next steps for our design system implementation:

1. Begin with [start-here.md](./start-here.md) which provides the current status and next tasks
2. Refer to the key resources listed in that file for more detailed information
3. Check the ESLint rules implementation status to understand our automated enforcement progress
4. Review the page audit status to see which pages have been refactored to align with the design system

## Key Principles

Our design system implementation follows these key principles:

1. Direct use of shadcn/ui components with Tailwind utility classes
2. Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
3. Standardized page structure following our established guidelines
4. Component consolidation replacing custom wrapper components

## Contributing

When working on the design system implementation:

1. Update the start-here.md file as tasks are completed or new tasks are identified
2. Document page audits in the appropriate templates
3. Follow the refactoring checklist when updating components
4. Test ESLint rules against existing code before implementation
