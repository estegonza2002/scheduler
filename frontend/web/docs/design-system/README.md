# Design System Documentation

This directory contains documentation for our application's design system, focusing on ensuring consistent look and feel across all content areas while leveraging shadcn/ui components.

## Documents

- [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md): Detailed plan with status tracking for implementing consistent design
- [Component Inventory](./component-inventory.md): List of all UI components with usage guidelines
- [Page Structure Guide](./page-structure-guide.md): Standards for page layout and structure
- [Refactoring Checklist](./refactoring-checklist.md): Checklist for ensuring components follow design system standards
- [ESLint Rules Plan](./eslint-rules-plan.md): Plan for implementing ESLint rules to enforce design system standards
- [ESLint Setup Guide](./setup-eslint-rules.md): Instructions for setting up and using the design system ESLint rules

## Design System Showcase

We've created a visual showcase of all design system components at `/design-system` in the application. This page demonstrates:

- All core components with interactive examples
- Proper implementation patterns
- Component combinations and layout structures
- Responsive behavior of components

This showcase serves as a live reference for developers implementing the design system.

## Core Components (Documented)

We've completed documentation for these key components:

1. **Page Structure Components**:

   - PageHeader - Consistent page titles and actions
   - HeaderContentSpacing - Standardized spacing between elements
   - ContentContainer - Proper content wrapping
   - ContentSection - Logical content grouping

2. **UI Components**:
   - Button - Interactive elements with consistent styling
   - Card - Content containers and grouping
   - EmptyState - Display when no content is available
   - AlertCard - Notification and alert messages
   - ItemCard - Grid and collection item display
   - FormSection - Form field grouping
   - FilterGroup - Organizing filter controls
   - SearchInput - Consistent search functionality
   - LoadingState - Loading indicators and spinners

## Quick Start

To ensure your page follows our design system:

1. Use the standard page structure:

   ```tsx
   <PageHeader title="Page Title" />
   <HeaderContentSpacing type="page">
     <ContentContainer>
       <ContentSection title="Section Title">
         {/* Content */}
       </ContentSection>
     </ContentContainer>
   </HeaderContentSpacing>
   ```

2. Follow the spacing guidelines:

   - Between header and content: `var(--header-content-spacing)`
   - Between sections: `var(--section-content-spacing)`
   - Between section title and content: `var(--section-header-spacing)`

3. Use shadcn/ui components directly when possible
4. Use Tailwind utility classes for minor adjustments

## Implementation Progress

Current progress:

- ‚úÖ All components documented with usage guidelines
- ‚úÖ Design system showcase page created
- ‚úÖ Page structure standards established
- üü° Component auditing in progress
- üü° ESLint rules for design system enforcement in place
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Page refactoring not yet started

## Using This Documentation

**For Developers:**

1. Review the [Page Structure Guide](./page-structure-guide.md) to understand the standard layout
2. Check [Component Inventory](./component-inventory.md) for usage guidelines on specific components
3. Use the implementation examples for consistent patterns

**For Design System Maintainers:**

1. Update component status in [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md) as tasks are completed
2. Add component usage guidelines to [Component Inventory](./component-inventory.md)
3. Update audit results for pages in [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md)

## Next Steps

See the [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md) for current priorities and next steps.

The immediate focus is on:

1. Refactoring existing pages to follow design system standards
2. Developing guidelines for component combinations and page patterns
3. Planning ESLint rules to enforce design system standards
4. Conducting design system workshop with development team

## Enforcing Standards

We use several mechanisms to enforce design system standards:

1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guidelines and examples in this documentation
2. **Showcase Page**: Visual reference at `/design-system` in the application
3. **ESLint Rules**: Automated checks that catch design system violations
4. **Code Reviews**: Design system compliance checked during code reviews
5. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Design system checks run before code is committed

See the [ESLint Setup Guide](./setup-eslint-rules.md) for instructions on setting up the automated checks.
