# Page Audit Status

## Current Focus

We are currently executing page audits following our process. Each page is being evaluated against our design system standards with a focus on replacing custom wrapper components with direct shadcn/ui usage and Tailwind CSS.

### Priority Pages

- **DashboardPage.tsx**: ✅ Completed

  - Direct Tailwind classes for page header/container
  - Removed custom wrapper components
  - Consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale

- **SchedulePage.tsx**: ✅ Completed
  - Direct Tailwind classes for page header/container
  - Removed custom wrapper components
  - Proper responsive design pattern

## Common Issues

We've identified these common patterns that need refactoring:

1. Custom wrapper components being used instead of direct shadcn/ui components
2. Inconsistent spacing between content sections
3. Mixed use of CSS variables and Tailwind classes for spacing
4. Inconsistent page header implementations

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete audits of DashboardPage.tsx and SchedulePage.tsx
2. Begin auditing EmployeeDetailPage.tsx
3. Document common patterns for refactoring in a reusable way
4. Continue updating ESLint rules to enforce new standards
