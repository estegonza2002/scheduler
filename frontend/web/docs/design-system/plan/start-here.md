# Design System Implementation - Start Here

## Current Status Overview

The design system implementation is currently in progress with these key components:

- Phase 1 (Documentation & Standards): ✅ **COMPLETED**

  - All core components documented
  - Page structure guidelines established
  - Component inventory created

- Phase 2 (Content Area Audit): 🟡 **IN PROGRESS**

  - Several important pages audited (DashboardPage, SchedulePage, LocationFinancialReport, EmployeeDetailPage)
  - Prioritized list of pages created for refactoring

- Phase 3 (Implementation & Refactoring): 🟡 **IN PROGRESS**

  - Multiple key components refactored to follow design system standards
  - High-priority pages refactored

- Phase 4 (Validation & Enforcement): 🟡 **IN PROGRESS**
  - ESLint rules plan created
  - Initial ESLint rules implemented for design system compliance
  - enforce-page-header rule completed and integrated with pre-commit hooks

## Immediate Next Tasks

1. **Continue medium-priority page refactoring** ⏩ HIGHEST PRIORITY

   - Focus on these medium-priority pages next:
     - NotificationsPage.tsx
     - LocationInsightsPage.tsx
     - LocationEmployeesPage.tsx
   - Apply consistent ContentSection pattern
   - Fix spacing and structure issues

2. **Continue ESLint rule implementation** ⏩ MEDIUM PRIORITY

   - Focus on practical rules with clear benefits
   - Add enforce-content-container rule to existing set

3. **Review refactored pages** ⏩ MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Check for consistent patterns across refactored pages
   - Look for remaining design system violations
   - Document remaining improvements needed

- ✅ Refactored SchedulePage.tsx to use direct Tailwind classes

## Testing ESLint Rules

To test the design system ESLint rules against a file:

```bash
# Test a specific file with the design system ESLint rules
node scripts/test-design-system-lint.js src/pages/SomePage.tsx

# Use the pre-commit hook to test all staged files
scripts/pre-commit-design-system.sh
```

The test files in `scripts/test-files/` can be used to verify each rule's functionality:

- `TestPage.tsx` - Missing PageHeader import
- `ImportedButNotUsedPage.tsx` - Imports but doesn't use PageHeader
- `IncorrectUsagePage.tsx` - Uses PageHeader without required title prop

## Implementation Principles

1. **Direct Use of shadcn/ui Components**: Use direct shadcn/ui components with Tailwind utility classes instead of creating custom wrappers.
2. **Consistent Spacing**: Use Tailwind's spacing scale consistently throughout the application.
3. **Standardized Page Structure**: Follow the page structure guidelines for all pages.
4. **Component Consolidation**: Replace custom wrapper components with direct shadcn/ui components.
