# Page Audit Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for auditing existing pages against our design system standards. The goal is to identify inconsistencies and areas for improvement to ensure a cohesive user experience.

## Process Steps

To complete our page audit efficiently, we'll follow this process:

1. **Initial Scan**:

   - Review all pages in the application to identify those using outdated patterns
   - Focus on high-traffic and critical user flows first

2. **Detailed Evaluation**:

   - For each page, check for:
     - Direct use of shadcn/ui components vs custom wrappers
     - Consistent Tailwind spacing patterns
     - Proper heading hierarchy using Tailwind classes
     - Card usage for content sections
     - Consistent page header implementation

3. **Documentation**:
   - Record issues found in the Page Audit Results table
   - Assign priority based on page visibility and importance
   - Estimate effort required for refactoring

## Audit Template

For each page being audited, create a new file in the `docs/design-system/audits/` directory using this naming convention:
`PageName-audit.md`

Use the [audit template](./audit-template.md) to ensure consistent documentation of findings.

## Current Status

See [audit-status.md](./audit-status.md) for the current status of page audits and priorities.
