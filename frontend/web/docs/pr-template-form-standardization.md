# Form Standardization Initiative

## Overview

This PR is part of our form standardization initiative to ensure all forms in the application follow consistent patterns, accessibility standards, and performance best practices. We're implementing shadCN components with Tailwind CSS across all forms to ensure a consistent user experience.

## Changes

- Refactored forms to use shadCN components
- Added FormSection components to logically group form fields
- Improved form accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Added proper validation patterns and error handling
- Optimized performance with memoized callbacks
- Ensured consistent styling across all forms

## Implementation Details

### Added Form Sections for Logical Grouping

```tsx
<FormSection
	title="Basic Information"
	description="Enter the location name and status">
	{/* Form fields */}
</FormSection>
```

### Improved Accessibility

```tsx
<FormLabel>
  Name <span className="text-destructive">*</span>
</FormLabel>
<Input
  {...field}
  aria-required="true"
  aria-invalid={!!form.formState.errors.name}
  required
/>
```

### Performance Optimization

```tsx
const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
	return form.handleSubmit(onSubmit);
}, [form]);
```

## Documentation

We've created a standardization tracking document and templates:

- Form Evaluation Template for assessing each form
- Form Best Practices Guide for reference
- Example evaluations for major forms

## Testing

- Verified all forms render correctly
- Tested form submission and validation
- Verified proper error handling
- Tested accessibility with screen readers
- Checked responsive design on mobile and desktop

## Next Steps

- Continue standardizing remaining forms
- Extract common validation patterns to shared utilities
- Create reusable form hooks for common patterns
