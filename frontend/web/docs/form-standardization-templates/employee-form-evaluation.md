# Form Evaluation: EmployeeForm

## Form Information

- **Form Name**: EmployeeForm
- **File Location**: src/components/EmployeeForm.tsx
- **Purpose**: Creating and editing employee records
- **Form Type**: Creation/Edit form with multiple sections

## Component Usage

- [x] Uses shadCN's `Form` component
- [x] Uses shadCN's `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage` components
- [x] Uses shadCN's `Input`, `Select`, etc. field components
- [x] Uses `FormSection` for logical grouping
- [x] Uses only Tailwind for styling (no custom CSS)

## Validation

- [x] Uses zod for validation
- [x] Schema defined outside component for reusability
- [x] Proper validation messages for common fields
- [x] Follows standard validation patterns for:
  - Email (`z.string().email("Please enter a valid email address")`)
  - Phone number (custom validation with `isValidPhoneNumber`)
  - Required fields (`min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters")`)
  - Numeric values (hourlyRate validation)
  - Date validation (hireDate with custom validation)

## Accessibility

- [x] Proper `aria-` attributes on inputs (`aria-required`, `aria-invalid`)
- [x] Required field indicators (`<span className="text-destructive">*</span>`)
- [x] Descriptive error messages
- [x] Proper label associations
- [ ] Could improve keyboard navigation in some areas

## Performance

- [x] Memoized callbacks (handleSubmit is memoized with useCallback)
- [x] Optimized useEffect dependencies (properly listed)
- [x] Uses control method efficiently
- [ ] Could optimize some re-renders in nested components

## Form Structure

- [x] Logical field grouping (using FormSection)
- [x] Consistent grid layout (`grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2`)
- [x] Mobile responsive layout
- [x] Icon decoration consistent with design system (User, Mail, Phone icons)
- [x] Consistent spacing between fields and sections

## State Management

- [x] Loading state during submission (isSubmitting state)
- [x] Error toast messages
- [x] Success handling with callbacks (onSuccess)
- [x] Partial form reset after submission (avoids resetting all fields)
- [x] Proper handling of API errors (including duplicate email check)

## Edge Cases

- [x] Handles validation of optional fields correctly
- [x] Validation for business rules (date ranges for hire date)
- [x] Proper error handling for API failures
- [ ] Could improve handling of concurrent edits

## Issues Identified

1. Date handling in the hireDate field is somewhat complex and could be simplified
2. The form doesn't provide a way to cancel during submission
3. Some validation messages could be more user-friendly

## Recommendations

1. Extract the date handling logic into a reusable hook or utility function
2. Add a cancel button with proper state management
3. Standardize validation messages across all forms for consistency
4. Consider adding field-level validation feedback as the user types for a better UX

## Standardization Tasks

- [ ] Extract common validation patterns to a shared utility
- [ ] Create a reusable date input component with standardized validation
- [ ] Update validation messages to follow a consistent pattern
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation improvements
