# Sticky Footer Implementation for Sheet Components

## Summary

We've implemented a consistent sticky footer pattern for all sheet components that contain forms or wizards. This ensures that all call-to-action buttons are positioned in a predictable and accessible location at the bottom of the sheet, following established UX best practices.

## Implementation Details

### Applied Components

The sticky footer pattern has been applied to the following components:

- `LocationEditSheet`
- `ShiftCreationSheet`
- `EmployeeSheet`
- `LocationCreationSheet`
- `EmployeeAssignmentSheet`
- `LocationAssignmentSheet`

### Pattern Guidelines

1. **Footer Position**: Footer is always positioned at the bottom of the content area
2. **Visual Separation**: A border-top is used to separate the footer from the content
3. **Button Placement**:
   - Cancel/Back buttons on the left
   - Submit/Continue buttons on the right
4. **Form Integration**: Buttons are properly connected to their respective forms
5. **Multi-step Support**: For wizards, buttons adapt based on the current step

### Key Changes

1. **Button Relocation**: Moved all submit/action buttons from content areas to `SheetFooter`
2. **Form Restructuring**: Updated forms to work with buttons placed outside the form element
3. **Wizard Adaptations**: Modified multi-step wizards to control navigation through the footer
4. **Consistency**: Standardized button text, icons, and positioning across all components

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users always know where to find primary actions
2. **Accessibility**: Fixed positioning makes buttons easier to reach on mobile
3. **Reduced Visual Noise**: Content areas focus on information, not actions
4. **Consistent Design Language**: All sheets follow the same interaction pattern
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Better experience on smaller screens where footer is always visible

## Technical Implementation

Most implementations follow this pattern:

```tsx
<Sheet>
	<SheetContent>
		<SheetHeader>
			<SheetTitle>Title</SheetTitle>
		</SheetHeader>

		<div className="py-4">
			<form id="form-id">{/* Form content */}</form>
		</div>

		<SheetFooter className="flex justify-between border-t pt-4">
			<Button
				variant="outline"
				onClick={onCancel}>
				Cancel
			</Button>
			<Button
				type="submit"
				form="form-id">
				Submit
			</Button>
		</SheetFooter>
	</SheetContent>
</Sheet>
```

## Design System Documentation

This pattern has been documented in the design system for future reference:

- Added a "Sheet Pattern: Sticky Footer" section to `docs/design-system/components/sheet.md`
- Updated implementation status in `docs/design-system/implementation-progress.md`

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a11y improvements to ensure footer is properly announced to screen readers
- Explore responsive adaptations for very small screen sizes
- Possibly add support for contextual help in the footer area
