# shadCN Sheet Component Consistency

Ensure all sheet components in the application follow our design system principles using shadCN components with Tailwind CSS only, avoiding custom CSS or unnecessary wrappers.

## Background

Our design system documentation indicates that we should use shadCN components with Tailwind utility classes for all UI elements. Sheet components (modal dialogs, slide-overs, etc.) are critical UI elements that need consistent styling and behavior.

## Tasks

### 1. Audit Existing Sheets

- [ ] Identify all sheet components across the application
- [ ] Document current implementation approach for each
- [ ] Identify sheets not using shadCN/Tailwind or using custom CSS
- [ ] Create inventory of all sheet variants currently in use

### 2. Define Standard Sheet Patterns

- [ ] Document standard sheet component implementation using shadCN
- [ ] Define common layout patterns for different sheet types:
  - [ ] Form sheets
  - [ ] Confirmation sheets
  - [ ] Information/detail sheets
  - [ ] Multi-step sheets
- [ ] Create guidelines for sheet animations and transitions
- [ ] Define responsive behavior standards

### 3. Implementation Updates

- [ ] Update non-compliant sheet components to use shadCN/Tailwind
- [ ] Remove any custom CSS related to sheets
- [ ] Eliminate unnecessary wrapper components
- [ ] Standardize sheet header/footer patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent sheet sizing across the application

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Add sheet component documentation to design system
- [ ] Create usage examples for common sheet patterns
- [ ] Update Tailwind guidelines to include sheet-specific recommendations
- [ ] Document best practices for accessibility with sheets

### 5. Testing and Verification

- [ ] Test all updated sheet components
- [ ] Verify consistent behavior across browsers
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works correctly
- [ ] Validate accessibility of sheet implementations

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

All sheet components have been successfully updated to use standard ShadCN components directly without custom wrappers. The `StandardSheet` wrapper component has been removed, and all sheets now follow consistent patterns.

## Components Update Approach

For consistency, all sheet components now use the standard ShadCN Sheet components directly:

1. We use the base ShadCN sheet components: `Sheet`, `SheetTrigger`, `SheetContent`, `SheetHeader`, etc.
2. Apply Tailwind utility classes directly to these components
3. Maintain consistent patterns for different sheet types (form, confirmation, information, multi-step)
4. Avoid custom wrapper components for simplicity and maintainability

## Components Updated

The following components have been successfully updated:

1. LocationEditSheet - A form sheet for editing locations
2. ShiftCreationSheet - A multi-step sheet for creating shifts
3. EmployeeSheet - A form sheet for creating/editing employees
4. LocationCreationSheet - A form sheet for creating locations
5. EmployeeAssignmentSheet - An information/assignment sheet
6. LocationAssignmentSheet - An information/assignment sheet
7. Confirmation pattern established for dangerous actions

## Benefits

- Enhanced consistency across the application
- Simplified codebase by removing unnecessary abstraction layers
- Direct use of ShadCN components improves maintainability
- Better adherence to design system standards
